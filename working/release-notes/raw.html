### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the use case or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

ADD RELEASE FEATURES BELOW

<p><a name="build-authoring"></a></p>
<h3><a href="#build-authoring-improvements" id="build-authoring-improvements">Build authoring improvements</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#introduce-attributecontaineraddalllater" id="introduce-attributecontaineraddalllater">Introduce <code>AttributeContainer#addAllLater</code></a></h4>
<p>This release introduces a new API on <code>AttributeContainer</code> allowing all attributes from one attribute container to be lazily added to another.</p>
<p>Consider the following example demonstrating the new API's behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val color = Attribute.of(&quot;color&quot;, String::class.java)
val shape = Attribute.of(&quot;shape&quot;, String::class.java)

val foo = configurations.create(&quot;foo&quot;).attributes
foo.attribute(color, &quot;green&quot;)

val bar = configurations.create(&quot;bar&quot;).attributes
bar.attribute(color, &quot;red&quot;)
bar.attribute(shape, &quot;square&quot;)
assert(bar.getAttribute(color) == &quot;red&quot;)    // `color` is originally red

bar.addAllLater(foo)
assert(bar.getAttribute(color) == &quot;green&quot;)  // `color` gets overwritten
assert(bar.getAttribute(shape) == &quot;square&quot;) // `shape` does not

foo.attribute(color, &quot;purple&quot;)
bar.getAttribute(color) == &quot;purple&quot;         // addAllLater is lazy

bar.attribute(color, &quot;orange&quot;)
assert(bar.getAttribute(color) == &quot;orange&quot;) // `color` gets overwritten again
assert(bar.getAttribute(shape) == &quot;square&quot;) // `shape` remains the same
</code></pre>
<h3><a href="#configuration-improvements" id="configuration-improvements">Configuration Improvements</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#simpler-target-package-configuration-for-antlr-4" id="simpler-target-package-configuration-for-antlr-4">Simpler target package configuration for Antlr 4</a></h4>
<p>The AntlrTask class now supports explicitly setting the target package for generated code when using Antlr 4.<br />
Previously, setting the &quot;-package&quot; argument also required setting the output directory in order to generate classes into the proper package-specific directory structure.
This release introduces a <code>packageName</code> property that allows you to set the target package without needing to also set the output directory properly.
Setting this property will set the &quot;-package&quot; argument for the Antlr tool, and will also set the generated class directory to match the package.</p>
<p>Explicitly setting the &quot;-package&quot; argument is now deprecated, and will become an error in Gradle 10.</p>
<p>This option is not available for versions before Antlr 4 and will result in an error if this property is set.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">tasks.named(&quot;generateGrammarSource&quot;).configure {
    // Set the target package for generated code
    packageName = &quot;com.example.generated&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h4><a href="#antlr-generated-sources-are-automatically-tracked" id="antlr-generated-sources-are-automatically-tracked">Antlr generated sources are automatically tracked</a></h4>
<p>In previous versions of Gradle, the Antlr-generated sources were added to a java source set for compilation, but if the generated sources directory was changed, this change was not reflected in the source set.<br />
This required manually updating the source set to include the new generated sources directory any time it was changed.
In this release, the generated sources directory is automatically tracked and updates the source set accordingly.
A task dependency is also created between the source generation task and the source set, ensuring that tasks that consume the source set as an input will automatically create a task dependency on the source generation task.</p>
