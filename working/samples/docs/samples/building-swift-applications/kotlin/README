This guide demonstrates how to create a Swift application with Gradle using `gradle init`.
You can follow the guide step-by-step to create a new project from scratch or download the complete sample project using the links above.

== What you’ll build

You'll generate a Swift application that follows Gradle's conventions.

== What you’ll need

* A text editor or IDE - for example link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA]
* A Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher - for example link:https://adoptopenjdk.net/[AdoptOpenJDK]
* The latest https://gradle.org/install[Gradle distribution]
* An installed Swift compiler. See which link:{userManualPath}/building_swift_projects.html#sec:swift_supported_tool_chain[Swift tool chains] are supported by Gradle.

== Create a project folder

Gradle comes with a built-in task, called `init`, that initializes a new Gradle project in an empty folder.
The `init` task uses the (also built-in) `wrapper` task to create a Gradle wrapper script, `gradlew`.

The first step is to create a folder for the new project and change directory into it.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ mkdir demo
$ cd demo
----

== Run the init task

From inside the new project directory, run the `init` task using the following command in a terminal: `gradle init`.
When prompted, select the `1: application` project type and `6: Swift` as the implementation language.
Next you can choose the DSL for writing buildscripts -  `1  : Kotlin` or `2: Groovy`.
For the other questions, press enter to use the default values.

The output will look like this:

[listing.terminal.sample-command,user-inputs="1|6|1|||"]
----
$ gradle init

Select type of build to generate:
  1: Application
  2: Library
  3: Gradle plugin
  4: Basic (build structure only)
Enter selection (default: Application) [1..4] 1

Select implementation language:
  1: Java
  2: Kotlin
  3: Groovy
  4: Scala
  5: C++
  6: Swift
Enter selection (default: Java) [1..6] 6

Project name (default: demo):

Select build script DSL:
  1: Kotlin
  2: Groovy
Enter selection (default: Kotlin) [1..2]

Generate build using new APIs and behavior (some features may change in the next minor release)? (default: no) [yes, no]

The `init` task generates the new project with the following structure:

<1> Generated folder for wrapper files
<2> Generated version catalog
<3> Gradle wrapper start scripts
<4> Settings file to define build name and subprojects
<5> Build script of `app` project
<6> Default Swift source folder
<7> Default Swift test source folder

You now have the project setup to build a Swift application.

== Review the project files

The `settings.gradle(.kts)` file has two interesting lines:

====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="settings.gradle[]"]
====
- `rootProject.name` assigns a name to the build, which overrides the default behavior of naming the build after the directory it's in.
  It's recommended to set a fixed name as the folder might change if the project is shared - e.g. as root of a Git repository.
- `include("app")` defines that the build consists of one subproject called `app` that contains the actual code and build logic.
  More subprojects can be added by additional `include(...)` statements.

Our build contains one subproject called `app` that represents the Swift application we are building.
It is configured in the `app/build.gradle(.kts)` file:

====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="app/build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="app/build.gradle[]"]
====
<1> Apply the swift-application plugin to add support for building Swift executables
<2> Apply the xctest plugin to add support for building and running Swift test executables (Linux) or bundles (macOS)
<3> Set the target operating system and architecture for this library

The file `src/main/swift/main.swift` is shown here:

.Generated src/main/swift/main.swift
[source,swift]
----
include::{samples-dir}/groovy/app/src/main/swift/main.swift[]
----

The generated test, `src/test/swift/main.swift` is shown next:

.Generated src/test/swift/GreeterTests.swift
[source,swift]
----
include::{samples-dir}/groovy/app/src/test/swift/GreeterTests.swift[]
----

The generated test class has a single _XCTest_ test.
The test instantiates the `Greeter` class, invokes a method on it, and checks that it returns the expected value.

== Build the application

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew build

7 actionable tasks: 7 executed

NOTE: The first time you run the wrapper script, `gradlew`, there may be a delay while that version of `gradle` is downloaded and stored locally in your `~/.gradle/wrapper/dists` folder.

The `build` task compiles the Swift sources, links the object files, and runs the tests.
It also packages the main and test applications for distribution on other systems.
The `installDebug` and `installTest` tasks, which both run as part of `build`, copy the executable and generates a shell script for executing the application.
The following shows the content of the `build/install` folder:

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
./app/build/install
├── main
│   └── debug
│       ├── app      // <1>
│       └── lib
│           └── app  // <2>
└── test
    ├── appTest      // <1>
    └── lib
        └── appTest  // <3>
----
<1> The script for executing the application variant
<2> The main executable binary (debug variant)
<3> The test executable binary

NOTE: When a build has dependencies, the dependent libraries are also copied into the installation folder.
The shell scripts properly configure the library path so the package can be relocated.

NOTE: Dependencies on other projects isn't covered in this guide.
To learn more about this subject, have a look at the https://github.com/gradle/native-samples/tree/master/cpp/transitive-dependencies[transitive dependency sample] for a demonstration.

NOTE: Gradle integrates with several IDEs: link:{userManualPath}/visual_studio_plugin.html[Visual Studio], link:{userManualPath}/xcode_plugin.html[Xcode] and https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/gradle-support.html[Clion].
To learn more, have a look at their respective linked documentation to configure those IDE integration in your project.

== Run the application

Look inside the `build` folder and you will notice the appearance of an `exe` folder.
By convention, Gradle will place all applications in subfolders named according to the component name.
In this case, you will find your assembled executable in `build/exe/main/debug` and it will be called `app` (or `app.exe` under Windows).

Now run your newly built executable.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./app/build/exe/main/debug/app
Hello, World!
----

== Publish a Build Scan

The best way to learn more about what your build is doing behind the scenes, is to publish a link:https://scans.gradle.com[Build Scan].
To do so, just run Gradle with the `--scan` flag.

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew build --scan
